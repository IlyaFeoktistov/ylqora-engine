# Scene: nodes, components, resources

[Русская версия](scene.ru.md)

This is the contract for everything that lives in a scene: what is a node,
what is a component, the lifecycle, references and serialization. It changes
together with the code.

Status marks: see [README](README.md).

## Design decisions

1. **Games add components, not node types.** Node types come only from the
   engine. A game still creates nodes of engine types (`Node`, `Node3D`,
   `Camera3D`, ...) in code and attaches its own components to them. The type
   tree of nodes never changes when a game module is reloaded.
2. **A script is a component.** It cannot exist in the world on its own, only
   attached to a node. Every script class is its own component type, in C++,
   in Luau and in visual scripts alike.
3. **One component of a type per node by default.** A type opts in to
   repetition with `.allowMultiple()`.
4. **The core does not assume 3D.** Only 3D is implemented in the MVP, 2D comes
   after it, as a separate family next to 3D rather than inside it.
5. **Rendering, physics and audio are components on a node, not node types.**
   A mesh is `MeshRenderer` on a `Node3D`; a 2D sprite will be `SpriteRenderer`
   on a `Node2D`.

## Core concepts

| | What it is | Who defines types | Examples |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Node** | An object of the scene with its own role, one row in the scene tree | engine only | `Node`, `Node3D`, `Camera3D`, lights, UI controls |
| **Component** | An ability or behaviour attached to a node | engine and game | `MeshRenderer`, `RigidBody`, `BoxCollider`, `AudioSource`, scripts |
| **Resource** | A project file with a stable ID | engine (formats) | mesh, material, shader, texture, sound, scene, script source |

How to choose:

- The object makes no sense without it and is visible as a thing of its own in
  the tree (a camera, a light): a **node**.
- It is an addition that fits many different objects: a **component**.
- It is data shared by several objects: a **resource**, and a component refers
  to it.

## Node hierarchy

```
Node                     no position: a group, a root, a holder of scripts
├── Node3D               built-in Transform3D (cannot be removed)
│   ├── Camera3D
│   └── DirectionalLight3D, PointLight3D, SpotLight3D      [planned, step 5]
├── Control              built-in RectTransform, anchors   [planned, step 8]
│   └── Label, Button, ...
└── Node2D               built-in Transform2D              [planned, after MVP]
    └── Camera2D, ...
```

- `Node2D` does not derive from `Node3D` and vice versa: the transforms have
  different meaning. They share only `Node`, the tree, the lifecycle and the
  editor infrastructure.
- A node class holds the properties of its role (field of view, light colour)
  and registers itself in scene systems in `onEnterScene` / `onExitScene`.
  **No game logic in node classes**: per-frame work of engine nodes belongs to
  their system. `onStart` / `onUpdate` / `onStop` are for components only
  **[done]**.

## Components

### Registration and rules [done]

```cpp
registry.registerComponent<MeshRenderer>()
    .requiresNode<Node3D>()               // which nodes it may live on
    .property("mesh", &MeshRenderer::mesh, &MeshRenderer::setMesh, PropertyHint::Mesh);

registry.registerComponent<BoxCollider>()
    .requiresNode<Node3D>()
    .requiresComponent<RigidBody>();      // needs a RigidBody on the same node

registry.registerComponent<AudioSource>()
    .requiresNode<Node3D>()
    .allowMultiple();
```

- `requiresNode<T>()`: the owner must be `T` or derived from it.
- `requiresComponent<T>()`: the same node must have a component of type `T`
  or derived from it. The editor adds it together with the dependent one, in
  one undo step. A required component cannot be removed while something
  depends on it: its header has no close button and the tooltip names the
  dependents. Removing the dependents too is never implicit.
- `allowMultiple()`: several components of this type on one node. Each
  instance is still checked against `requiresNode` and `requiresComponent`.
- Rules are inherited: the rules of a base component type apply to derived
  ones.
- The base type comes from `YQLORA_TYPE(Class, Base)`, not from a second
  template argument of the registration, and registration does not compile
  if the class does not derive from it **[done]**.

`requires` is a C++20 keyword, hence `requiresNode` / `requiresComponent`.

### Who enforces the rules

The checks themselves are free functions in `ComponentRules.hpp` (`canAttach`,
`missingRequirements`, `dependentsOf`); everyone below calls them.

- The editor, through `EditorSession` **[done]**.
- The scene loader: a component on a node it does not fit is skipped with an
  error in the log; a missing required component is added with a warning
  **[done]**.
- `Node::addComponent` itself, for a node in a scene: it adds missing required
  components first, like `AddComponent` in Unity, and a broken rule is an error
  of the program, so game code cannot bypass them either **[done]**.

### Built-in components

A spatial node creates its transform in the constructor (`Transform3D` for
`Node3D`). It cannot be removed and is not offered in "Add component".

## Lifecycle

| Call | Where | What for |
|---|---|---|
| constructor | anywhere | defaults; no scene yet |
| `onEnterScene` / `onExitScene` | editor and game | register in scene systems (physics, audio, lights) |
| `onEnable` / `onDisable` | game only | the component starts or stops taking part: enabled and its node active in hierarchy **[done]** |
| `onStart` | game only | once, before the first phase call of the component |
| `onFixedUpdate(step)` | game only | physics, fixed step of game time **[done]** |
| `onUpdate(delta)` | game only | per-frame logic |
| `onLateUpdate(delta)` | game only | after all updates: follow cameras **[done]** |
| `onStop` | game only | release what `onStart` took |

### Phase lists instead of a tree walk [done]

- A scene keeps one list per phase (fixed update, update, late update) and
  calls only the components in it. A component gets into a list only if its
  type overrides that phase; the registry finds this out when the type is
  registered (`PhaseDetector` compares the declaring class of `onUpdate` and
  the others; `YQLORA_TYPE` makes it a friend of the class). No tree walk, no
  empty virtual calls.
- Order inside a phase: the **execution order** of the type (default 0, lower
  first), then the order in which components entered the list. A type sets its
  default in code (`.executionOrder(-100)`); the project settings can override
  it per type, like Script Execution Order in Unity (see
  [project settings](project-settings.md)). One rule: the setting if present,
  else the default from code.
- A component added during a phase is called from the next phase on; a removed
  one is skipped at once and dropped from the list after the phase, so the
  lists never change under an iteration.

### Active and enabled [done]

As in Unity:

- A node has `active` (its own flag) and `activeInHierarchy()` (it and all its
  parents are active). An inactive node switches off its whole branch:
  components get `onDisable`, leave the phase lists, renderers are not drawn,
  bodies leave the physics world.
- A component has `enabled`. It takes part in the game only while enabled and
  its node is active in hierarchy; `onEnable` / `onDisable` mark the change.
- There is no separate `visible` flag: hiding a mesh is disabling its
  `MeshRenderer`, like `Renderer.enabled` in Unity.
- A node has a **layer** (one of 32, names in the project settings). Camera
  masks and physics collisions filter by layers **[done]**; until the layer
  names come, the inspector shows numbers.
- An exception from a lifecycle call is caught: the component is disabled, the
  error goes to the log, the game goes on.
- `active` and `enabled` are ordinary registry properties (of `Node` and of
  the `Component` root type): the scene file, the inspector, undo and later
  the script bindings get them without extra code.
- `onEnable` comes before `onStart` and before the first phase after the
  component is enabled again; `onDisable` comes at once on disabling and
  before `onStop`. Re-enabling does not repeat `onStart`.
- A builtin component (`Transform3D`) cannot be disabled, as it cannot be
  removed: it has no `enabled` property.

### Deferred tree changes [done]

Destroying a node and changing its parent during a frame are applied at the
end of the frame, so no phase sees a half-changed tree. Nodes created during a
frame take part from the next one.

```cpp
scene.destroy(node);              // the node with its branch, the root too
scene.setParent(node, newParent, KeepWorld::No); // last child of newParent
```

- Outside a frame (editor, loading, tests) both apply at once; `inFrame()`
  tells which case it is.
- The queue refers to nodes by ID: a node gone with a destroyed branch is
  skipped, destroying twice is harmless.
- A move keeps the components running (no `onDisable` / `onEnable`, unless the
  new parent changes `activeInHierarchy`). What happens to the position is
  the choice below.
- A component enabled during a frame, like one of a new node, takes part from
  the next frame.
- `removeChild`, `setRoot` and `takeRoot` during a frame are a programming
  error: they would change the tree under the phases.

### Changing the parent: local or world position

Both are needed: a sword taken into a hand gets a new position relative to
the hand; a wagon hooked to a train must not move in the world.

- **Scripts** say it in every call, there is no default (Unity and Godot have
  opposite ones, any default would surprise someone) **[done]**:

  ```cpp
  scene.setParent(sword, hand, KeepWorld::No);    // local values stay, the node jumps
  scene.setParent(wagon, train, KeepWorld::Yes);  // stays in place in the world
  ```

- **The editor** asks when a node is dragged to another parent in the tree:
  "Keep the world position?" with a "Remember my choice" checkbox. The choice
  is an editor setting (a habit of the person, not a property of the game) and
  can be changed there. Alt while dropping does the opposite once. Undo returns
  both the parent and the old transform. Comes with dragging nodes in the tree
  **[planned, step 4]**.
- Keeping the world position is not always exact: under a parent with
  non-uniform scale and rotation the world matrix has a skew that position,
  rotation and scale cannot hold; the nearest values are taken, as in Unity.
- Nodes without a transform (`Node`) and parents that are not `Node3D` have
  nothing to recompute: the flag changes nothing there.

## Inside the scene [next]

`Scene` keeps the tree and the order of `advance`; the work is done by parts
it owns. Its public interface stays as it is.

- `ComponentLifecycle`: the phase lists, the start queues, `onEnable` /
  `onDisable`, calls guarded against exceptions.
- `TreeChangeQueue`: deferred destroying and changes of parent.
- `SceneSystems`: systems created from the registry, lookup by type, calls in
  the order of registration.
- `ComponentIndex`: components by type name.

## References, state and serialization

- A reference to a node is a `NodeId`, to a resource a `ResourceId`; both are
  property types. A raw pointer to another node or component may be kept only
  between `onEnterScene` and `onExitScene` and must be dropped on exit.
- **Registered properties are saved; everything else is run-time state.** The
  Play copy and hot reload go through serialization, so only properties
  survive them. That is the contract for scripts: whatever must survive a
  reload is a property.
- Serialization restores state, it does not manage lifetimes: subscriptions,
  system registrations and resources are released in `onStop` /
  `onExitScene` before a module is unloaded.

## Editor integration

- The inspector is built from properties and their hints (`PropertyHint`). A
  custom inspector for a type is added only when hints are not enough.
- "Add component" lists only the types that fit the node: `requiresNode`, the
  one-per-node rule and requirements that can be met **[done]**.
- Gizmos for a type live in `editor/ui/gizmos` (like `CameraGizmo`); the engine
  knows nothing about them.
