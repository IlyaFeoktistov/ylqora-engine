# Editor

[Русская версия](editor.ru.md)

The editor is an application on the engine: the project manager, scene
editing and Play. Its logic lives in `editor/src` without ImGui, drawing in
`editor/ui`.

Status marks: see [README](README.md).

## Parts

- `EditorApp` assembles the editor: theme, settings, actions, panels.
- `EditorSession` holds the open project, the scene document, Play, the
  selection, the edit history (undo and redo of the scene and of the project
  settings), `SceneEditing` and `SettingsEditing`.
- `SceneDocument` is the edited scene and its file.
- **Unsaved changes** follow one rule for the scene and the project
  settings: a thing is unsaved while it differs from its file, however it
  was changed, through the history or not. The scene document keeps the
  scene as written to its file and compares after every edit, undo and redo,
  twice a second otherwise, and right before asking about unsaved changes;
  the settings compare their sections the same way. The one question is
  `EditorSession::modified()`; the history is only undo and redo **[done]**.
- `PlayMode` is the Play copy of the scene with its own services.
- Panels in `editor/ui` get an `EditorContext` every frame.

## Splitting [done]

- Editing (creating and deleting nodes, components, properties, transforms)
  lives in `SceneEditing` (`session.editing()`), which changes the current
  scene through commands. Project settings are changed by `SettingsEditing`
  (`session.settingsEditing()`); undo and redo are the session's, the history
  is shared.
- The session puts the open project into the engine services itself when it
  opens and closes a project; the window title is built by `windowTitle`,
  without ImGui.
- `EditorContext` gives panels an `EditorHost` instead of the whole
  `Application`: the renderer, the depth range, input, the language, the
  folder dialog. `RenderView` takes only the renderer.
- The scene document owns its scene; the application has none.
- The name of a resource in the inspector (a built-in mesh, a path in the
  project) is resolved by `resourceLabel` in `editor/src`, without ImGui.
- The main scene of the project lives in the project settings, section
  General (see [project settings](project-settings.md)) **[done]**.

## Panels and property fields [done]

- Every panel opens its window through `EditorPanel::beginWindow`: one place
  for what all windows share.
- **Maximize**: any panel can fill the whole editor window and go back. A
  square button left of the close button (in the title of a floating window,
  in the tab bar of a docked one), Shift+Space for the focused panel, a
  right click on the tab or title, a double click on a docked tab, or View ->
  Maximize window. The maximized panel is a separate ImGui window over the
  work area; the dock layout is kept alive but not shown, so it comes back
  unchanged.
- **Property menu**: a right click on a property row in the inspector or the
  settings window. Every menu item says what it acts on:
  - "Reset value to default", "Copy value", "Paste value" act on the whole
    value: three numbers of a position, a colour, a list. The default is the
    value of a new object of the same type (`defaultValue`; a built-in
    component takes it from a new node of the owner's type). Copy puts the
    value on the system clipboard as the same JSON as in the files, so a
    position can be pasted into a scale; a string property takes any text.
  - A right click on one number of a vector (its X, Y, Z or W label or field)
    adds, above the whole value items, "Reset X", "Copy X", "Paste into X"
    for that number alone. "Paste into X" takes only a single number; three
    numbers are pasted with "Paste value".
  - Ctrl+C and Ctrl+V inside a field being edited copy its text, as in any
    text field.
  - Reset and paste are ordinary edits and are undone with Ctrl+Z.
- The label column of a property table fits the longest label, up to half
  the width; a clipped label shows its full text as a tooltip.

## Log [done]

- The engine log has subscribers (`log::subscribe`, internal): a listener
  is called outside the lock of the log, and the owning `log::Subscription`
  unsubscribes, waiting for a call already running.
- `LogBuffer` (`editor/`) keeps the last entries with their level and source
  (the engine, the script build). Any thread adds; the main thread takes new
  entries with `collect()` every frame, so the interface never sees the list
  change under it. `LogFilter` picks entries by level and text.
- The Log panel sits as a tab next to Files: level toggles with counters,
  search, clear, copy one entry or everything shown; while scrolled to the
  end it follows new entries. The main menu shows the error and warning
  counters on the right; a click opens the log.
- Build output goes to the same buffer with the source "build"; every line
  gets its level from `CompilerDiagnostics` (GCC, Clang, MSVC, the linker,
  CMake), so compiler errors count as errors.
- A window added by a new version of the editor docks where the default
  layout would put it, unless `imgui.ini` already knows it
  (`dockNewWindows`).

## Building scripts [done]

- `ScriptBuild` builds the game module on its own thread, one build at a
  time; requests during a build give exactly one more. Triggers: Scripts >
  Build (Ctrl+B), Play, opening a project and the editor window getting
  focus. All but the first are quiet: when Ninja has nothing to do, the log
  stays empty. Play waits for the build and does not start if it failed;
  pressing it again while waiting cancels Play.
- Play brings the game view forward; if the scene view was shown before,
  Stop brings it back. An opened project starts with the scene view.
- A successful build whose library changed reloads the module
  (`EditorSession::reloadGameModule`, see [scripts](scripting.md)).
- The main menu shows "Building scripts..." during a build and a red mark
  after a failed one.
- The Scripts menu: Build. Scripts are created in Files: Create resource
  lists `newResourceTypes()` (folder, scene, C++ script; Luau and visual
  scripts, materials join with their steps). Every kind asks for a name
  first (a free one is suggested) and is made by the Create button: Cancel
  leaves nothing behind. A C++ script's name is its class name; it is made
  from `assets/templates/cpp-script/`. A double click on a
  file that is not a scene opens it with the system (`platform::openWithSystem`).

## Resources in the editor [done]

- **Files** shows a model and a picture with their own icons (the kind
  comes from the loader, `ResourceCache::kindOf`, files are not read). A
  model opens into its meshes. Any resource can be dragged.
- **Selection**: clicking a resource in Files selects it instead of nodes,
  as in Unity (`Selection::selectResource`), and the inspector shows the
  file (`ResourceInspector`, data from `inspectResource`): the meshes of a
  model with vertex, triangle and submesh counts, the size and a preview of
  a texture, the state and the message if the file is not loaded. Import
  settings (model scale; texture colour space, filter, wrap, mipmaps) are
  edited there and written to `.meta` by "Apply" (`applyImportSettings`):
  the file is read again with a new revision. This is not in the edit
  history: the file and its `.meta` are not the scene.
- **Into the scene**: a model or a mesh dropped onto a node of the scene
  tree becomes its child, onto the empty place under the tree - a child of
  the root, into the viewport - at the point on the ground under the cursor
  (`placementPoint`). A model becomes a `Node3D` named after the file with
  the nodes of the model under it, a mesh - a `Node3D` with a
  `MeshRenderer` (`instantiateResource`). One undo step
  (`SceneEditing::addResource`, `AddBranchCommand`).
- **Into a field**: a resource dropped onto a resource field is taken if it
  is of the kind of the field (mesh, texture, scene). The mesh list of
  `MeshRenderer` holds the built-in meshes and the meshes of every model,
  grouped by file; a nested resource reads "models/house.glb / Door".
- **Changes on disk**: when the editor window gets focus, the session walks
  the project folder again and reloads changed files
  (`EditorSession::refreshResources`).

## Snapping while moving [planned, step 4]

As in Unity: a node is placed exactly on the grid, onto a vertex or onto a
surface, not by eye. It works in the manipulator and when a model is
dragged from Files into the viewport.

- **To the grid**: moving by a step (1 m, 0.5 m or a custom one), rotating
  and scaling by their own steps. A button with the step choice on the
  viewport toolbar turns snapping on; Ctrl while dragging turns it on for
  that drag. The steps and the button state are editor settings
  (`EditorSettings`), not project ones: they are a habit of the person.
- **To vertices**: with V held, the manipulator takes the vertex of the
  selected mesh closest to the cursor and drags it to a vertex of another
  mesh under the cursor.
- **Onto a surface**: with Ctrl+Shift held, the node is put at the surface
  point under the cursor (a ray into mesh triangles, as in picking); a
  separate button also turns it along the surface normal.
- The keys are editor actions (`EditorActions`) and can be rebound; every
  mode has a button on the viewport toolbar whose tooltip shows its key.
- A snapped move is one edit in the history, as an unsnapped one.
