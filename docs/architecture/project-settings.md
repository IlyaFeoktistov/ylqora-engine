# Project settings

[Русская версия](project-settings.ru.md)

Settings of a game that live in its project folder, are shared by everyone who
works on it and go to version control: input actions, time step, graphics API,
physics, build targets. In the editor: **Project -> Project Settings**.

Status marks as in [README](README.md): **[done]**, **[next]** (before C++
scripts), **[planned, step N]**.

Not to be confused with **editor preferences** (theme, language, camera
speed): those belong to the user, live in the user profile (`Settings`) and
never go into the project.

## Design decisions

1. **A settings section is a class with registered properties**, in the same
   type registry as nodes and components (`TypeKind::Settings`). One
   description gives the file format, the editor window (the same property
   editor as the inspector) and access from code. No second list of fields
   anywhere.
2. **Each section belongs to its system.** Physics declares its section,
   input declares its own; there is no class with all settings. A game module
   may register sections of its own; they show up in the window like the
   engine ones and leave with the module on reload.
3. **One file per section**: `settings/<section>.json` in the project folder.
   Fewer merge conflicts, a readable diff. The files are part of the project
   format version: a change of their format means a migration and the project
   upgrade window, as for scenes.
4. **Edits are undone with Ctrl+Z**, through the same edit history as scene
   edits. The history therefore holds commands on the project, not only on
   the scene: it belongs to `EditorSession`, not to the scene document.
   Opening another scene clears the history, settings edits included
   **[done]**.
6. **Saved with the project, not on every edit.** An edit applies at once
   (in Play too) but reaches the file only on Save (Ctrl+S), which writes the
   scene and every modified section. A section is modified while its values
   differ from its file (`ProjectSettings::modified`), so an edit undone back
   to the old value leaves nothing to save. The title shows "*" when the
   scene or a section is unsaved; closing the project or quitting asks about
   both, opening another scene asks only about the scene, unsaved settings
   stay **[done]**.
5. **Input goes through actions from the start.** Scripts ask for
   `input.action("Jump")`, not for a key, so rebinding never touches game code.

## Sections

| Section | Contents | When |
|---|---|---|
| General | game name, version, company, startup scene, icon (a texture of the project; the game window takes it, the editor keeps its own) | **[done]** |
| Time | fixed time step, longest frame; read every frame by the scene and the frame loop, so an edit applies at once, in Play too | **[done]** |
| Input | actions and axes, their bindings to keys, the mouse and gamepads; see [input](input.md) | **[done]** |
| Execution Order | order of component types inside every lifecycle phase, overriding the default from code (see [scene](scene.md)); a type is picked from the registered components that use the frame phases, rows of unloaded types are kept. An edit applies from the next frame, in Play too: every write of a section raises `ProjectSettings::revision`, and the phase lists re-sort when it changes | **[done]** |
| Layers | names of the 32 node layers used by camera masks and physics | **[done]** |
| Graphics | graphics API per platform (OpenGL; Vulkan and D3D12 come with the RHI), vsync; both apply at once, see [rendering](rendering.md) | **[done]** |
| Scripts | C++ build configuration (Debug, Release), used as `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE`; each configuration has its own build folder. The toolchain is per machine: it comes from `sdk/toolchain.json`, overrides go to the editor settings (`editor.json`, `toolchain`), see [scripts](scripting.md); Luau later | **[done]** |
| Physics | gravity, layers, collision matrix | **[planned, step 6]** |
| Audio | master volume, sample rate | **[planned, step 7]** |
| Display | resolution, fullscreen, resizable window | **[planned, step 9]** |
| Build | target platforms (Windows, Linux), scenes in the game, output folder, debug or release | **[planned, step 9]** |

The startup scene lives in General (`GeneralSettings::startupScene`);
`project.yqlora` keeps only the project name and the engine version **[done]**.

## Registration

```cpp
class PhysicsSettings final : public SettingsSection {
public:
    YQLORA_TYPE(PhysicsSettings, SettingsSection)   // type name, as for nodes

    Vec3 gravity{0.0f, -9.81f, 0.0f};
};

registry.registerSettings<PhysicsSettings>("physics")  // settings/physics.json
    .property("gravity", &PhysicsSettings::gravity);
```

`SettingsSection` is the root of sections, like `Node` and `Component`. The
file name, the type name and the fields are written once **[done]**. A file
holds the format version and the values under `values`, so a property named
`version` does not clash with the format key.

## Access

- The project owns one instance of every registered section
  (`ProjectSettings`), created with defaults and filled from its file. A
  missing file means defaults; a file of a section nobody registers any more
  is never touched, so a module that failed to load does not lose its
  settings **[done]**.
- A system reads its section from the project it runs with:
  `project.settings().get<PhysicsSettings>()` **[done]**. The runtime
  (step 9) loads the same files.
- A game module registers only scripts, so it has no sections, and its
  reload leaves the settings alone **[done]**. Sections of a reloaded plugin
  module are in [plugins](plugins.md).
- Every setting applies at once, including during Play. Nothing asks for a
  restart: even a new graphics API rebuilds only the renderer (see
  [rendering](rendering.md)) **[done]**.

## Window

**Project -> Project Settings**: sections on the left, the properties of the
selected one on the right, drawn by the same property table as the inspector.
The settings folder and the project file are hidden from the Files panel and
cannot be changed there. Above the sections the window shows the project
version (the format of the project files) as plain text: it is not a setting
and changes only through the project upgrade, never by hand. The version of
the game itself, for players, is the editable `gameVersion` in General
**[done]**.

## Input actions

Described in [input](input.md).

## Layers

As Tags and Layers in Unity:

- 32 layers. Layer 0 is `Default`, always there and not renamed; the others
  are named by the project. A layer without a name is unused and does not
  appear in the lists.
- A node and a camera mask store layer numbers, so renaming a layer changes
  nothing in scenes. Clearing the name of a layer still in use asks first and
  leaves the nodes on it. Nodes are looked for in every scene of the project
  (the open one with its unsaved edits, the others from their files); camera
  masks do not count, the mask "Everything" covers unnamed layers too.
- The layer list in the inspector and the culling mask show the names and end
  with "Edit layers...", which opens this section. A layer without a name is
  still shown while it is selected, by its number.
- `LayerSettings` (scene/) holds exactly 32 names; the editor shows them as
  fixed rows, the `Default` row disabled **[done]**.
- Physics (step 6) takes the same layers for its collision matrix.

## What the registry needs

- List properties (actions, bindings, layers): `PropertyType::List` with an
  element type, any property type except a list; `std::vector<T>` fields
  register as lists, JSON writes them as arrays, the inspector as rows with
  add and remove **[done]**.
- Records: a C++ struct stored whole (`PropertyType::Record`, `RecordValue`
  with the field values in order). Its fields are described once next to the
  struct with `YQLORA_RECORD` (`reflection/Record.hpp`); from that the
  property gets the field descriptions (`Property::fields`), JSON writes an
  object by field names (a missing field takes the default from `T{}`), the
  inspector draws the fields as a small table. A record field may itself be a
  list or a record; lists of records are how Execution Order and the input
  actions are stored **[done]**.
- A binding property: a string with `PropertyHint::InputControl`, set by
  pressing in the editor **[done]**.
- The settings kind (`TypeKind::Settings`) and its builder **[done]**.
